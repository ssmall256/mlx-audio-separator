"""Fused GroupNorm+GELU must match the unfused path at the shapes htdemucs uses.

The test that existed fed a *constant* input, which makes the reduction
order-independent by construction -- so the threadgroup race below could not
show up, and the kernel shipped for seven months producing wrong output on the
frequency-branch DConv shapes.

The kernel reduces in three passes through one `shared_sums` array. Pass 1 ends
with every simdgroup reading `shared_sums[0]` as the mean; pass 2 has simdgroup
0 write that same slot. Without a barrier between them a fast simdgroup
clobbers the mean before a lagging one has loaded it. The window is widest when
pass 2's loop is *short*, i.e. at small `elems_per_group` -- which is exactly
the freq-branch shapes, not the large ones anyone would have worried about.
